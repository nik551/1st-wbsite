# Welcome to Nikhil's  Website 
I am going to write about my favourite song'LOVELY' by Billy Ellish."Lovely" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by American singer-songwriters Billie Eilish and Khalid for the official soundtrack of the second season of the Netflix drama series 13 Reasons Why.[1] The song was released on April 19, 2018, through Darkroom and Interscope Records.[2] It was written by the lead artists and Eilish's brother Finneas O'Connell, who also produced the track.[3] The song reached the top five in Australia and New Zealand and was certified Platinum in several countries including the United States and Canada.[4][5] The song was later included on the expanded edition and Japanese edition of Eilish's EP Don't Smile at Me (2017).
